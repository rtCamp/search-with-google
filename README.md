## Description
This plugin will replace the WordPress default search query with server-side results from either the [Custom Search Site Restricted JSON API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/site_restricted_api) or the [Custom Search JSON API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview). You can make your selection within the settings > Reading > Search type. This replacement is done on the WordPress back-end, so results appear as normal within WordPress search.

## Requirements
- [Google API Key](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
- [Programmable Search engine ID](https://cse.google.com/all)

## Setup
- [Get Google API key](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction). An API key is a way to identify your client to Google.
- [Get Programmable Search engine ID](https://cse.google.com/). In settings, restrict the Search engine to only search for your one site.
- On WordPress dashboard, set API Key and Custom Search Engine ID in the plugin settings. `Dashboard > Settings > Reading > Search with Google Settings`.
- Select the search type from Custom Search Site Restricted JSON API or Custom Search API. (Refer [#Notes](#notes) section for more details)

## Notes
- Custom Search Site Restricted JSON API can show only 100 search results for the query.
- A result page can have maximum of 10 results.
- Assistance for Custom Site Restricted Search JSON API is scheduled to cease as of December 18, 2024. [Read more](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/site_restricted_api). Due to this modification, we are introducing an opt-in feature that enables the use of solely the Custom Search API, as opposed to the Custom Site-restricted Search API. This will allow you to continue using the Custom Search API after December 18, 2024.
- Custom Site Search API has a daily limit of 10,000 queries per day. [Read more](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview#pricing).
